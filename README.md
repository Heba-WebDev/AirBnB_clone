# Airbnb Clone Project

Welcome to the Airbnb Clone project.

This is a Python-based project where we aim to create a simplified version of the popular Airbnb platform. The project is in its early stages, and this README wil be updated as the project progresses.

This stage involves writing a command interpreter to manage the AirBnB clone objects
